<ul>The final backend project I completed for LaunchCode LiftOff in April, 2021. This Repo contains: 
<p>
  <li>The User Backend with simple security and authentication features, incorporated into the other backend API I created. (You can see a simpler version of the User Profile API MVC project <a href="https://github.com/NikkiBausch/Coffee-Social-App-">HERE</a>. </li>
  <li>The Backend RestAPI I created for the Review writing section of the app, with authentication. </li>
  <li>The local proxy config measures to connect the frontend features on Port:4200 and backend on 8080 so that we can run a demo locally. </li>

  </ul> 
  <p>
  The repo is in the master branch here:

  <a href= "https://github.com/NikkiBausch/Coffee-Social-App-Backend-All/tree/master"> Project Repo for the whole backend </a> 
  <br>
  There are some Git branching issues, mostly because I had had this set upstream to go to the frontend project repo (not owned by me), and I have had to change it on the fly. But I won't be completing anything else on this project, as the idea belongs to someone else in the group.
